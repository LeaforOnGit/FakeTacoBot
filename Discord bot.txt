Discord bot:

Taco bot
each user has X tacos per day
each user can give tacos to other users 
	by sending a message in the server 
	with the taco emoji and the receiver user @
the bot should keep track of the tacos of each user


trying to send a taco to multiple people at the same time
	should have some kind of "protection" 
	maybe ask for confirmation?
Taco shop?
